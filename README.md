# SQL for Data Analysis
This is a collection of SQL statements that solve the exercises from Udacity's "SQL for Data Analysis" course.

## Project Motivation
Even if advanced Machine Learning and Statistics techniques are very useful, and there are many languages and libraries that allow to use those very efficiently, a great part of the work of many Data Scientists requires running SQL queries. As my proficiency in SQL was not too good, I decided to take this course and record all the solutions I found to the exercises.

## File Descriptions
The files are organized by lesson.

## How to interact with the project
The sql statements, that are written in the ".sql" files, are supposed to be run in the internal environment of the "SQL for Data Analysis" course. You could also create a mock database, following the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in "erd.png", and then run the SQL statements on it.
